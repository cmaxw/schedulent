# Schedulent

Schedulent is a project focused around putting recurring tasks into systems that allow to-do's but don't create routine todo's.

## Use Case

In Basecamp, create a to-do list each day for a morning routine. This will include tasks added to the to-do list in schedulent.

After the list's expiry period, remove the to-do's that don't get done.

## Required features
